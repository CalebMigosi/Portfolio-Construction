## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to a progressive implementation and maintenance of various and state-to-the art techniques related to investment management decisions, portfolio construction and allocation techniques. Firstly, my interest in building these modules came from my desire to have a better risk management of the portfolio of ETFs (Trackers or Exchange-Traded Funds) that I set up to dynamise and better manage my personal savings. To do so, I did some research on the matter and finally decided to put the useful stuffs that I found here. 

The other reason is because of my ability to learn better and quicker by doing. This notebook will allow me to implement, save and test (understand backtest here) these optimization and allocation techniques. Please, be aware that I am still learning and feel free to make some constructive comments.

  - **Efficient risk** : hfshglsmhgslhgsm vshmshgshgmlssgjslgs
  - **Global minimum variance**
  - **Maximum sharpe ratio portfolio**
  - **Equally-weighted portfolio**
 
## To do / Improvement
This project is ongoing and there is still a lot to do in order to cover all aspects of portfolio management. Hereafter, some ideas / techniques and methods I will implement very soon: 
- Risk estimates techniques (covariance estimates)
- Expected returns estimates techniques
- Allocation strategies and techniques (CPPI, LDI...)
- Custom portfolio optimization
